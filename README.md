Infrastructure as Code using Terraform to provision AWS resources (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3)
# AWS Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Learning Infrastructure as Code by codifying AWS infrastructure using Terraform.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Recreate my previous manual AWS infrastructure setups using Terraform for:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible environments
- Automated provisioning
- Best practices implementation

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **IaC Tool:** Terraform
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS
- **Resources:** VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, Security Groups, IAM
- **State Management:** S3 backend with DynamoDB locking
- **Version Control:** Git

## 📦 Infrastructure Components

### Phase 1: Networking (In Progress)
- [x] VPC with CIDR block
- [x] Public and private subnets
- [x] Internet Gateway
- [ ] NAT Gateway
- [ ] Route tables

### Phase 2: Compute (Planned)
- [ ] EC2 instances with Auto Scaling
- [ ] Application Load Balancer
- [ ] Security Groups and NACLs

### Phase 3: Database & Storage (Planned)
- [ ] RDS Multi-AZ deployment
- [ ] S3 buckets with lifecycle policies
- [ ] Backup configurations

### Phase 4: Security & Monitoring (Planned)
- [ ] IAM roles and policies
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms
- [ ] CloudTrail logging

## 🚀 Status

**Just Started** - January 2025

Learning Terraform fundamentals through HashiCorp tutorials while planning infrastructure architecture based on my 5+ years of AWS hands-on experience.

## 📖 Background

Previously managed AWS infrastructure manually through Console and CLI during my tenure at Netrix Global (2020-2023). Now transitioning to declarative Infrastructure as Code approach using Terraform.

**Previous Experience:**
- Migrated 50+ on-premises servers to AWS
- Managed VPCs, EC2, RDS, S3 for 1000+ users
- Achieved 99.9% uptime for enterprise environments
